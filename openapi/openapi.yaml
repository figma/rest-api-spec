            Comma separated list of nodes that you care about in the document. If specified, only a subset of the document will be returned corresponding to the nodes listed, their children, and everything between the root node and the listed nodes.

            Note: There may be other nodes included in the returned JSON that are outside the ancestor chains of the desired nodes. The response may also include dependencies of anything in the nodes' subtrees. For example, if a node subtree contains an instance of a local component that lives elsewhere in that file, that component and its ancestor chain will also be included.

            For historical reasons, top-level canvas nodes are always returned, regardless of whether they are listed in the `ids` parameter. This quirk may be removed in a future version of the API.

        Returns the nodes referenced to by `ids` as a JSON object. The nodes are retrieved from the Figma file referenced to by `file_key`.

        The node ID and file key can be parsed from any Figma node url: `https://www.figma.com/file/{file_key}/{title}?node-id={id}`

        The `name`, `lastModified`, `thumbnailUrl`, `editorType`, and `version` attributes are all metadata of the specified file.

        The `linkAccess` field describes the file link share permission level. There are 5 types of permissions a shared link can have: `"inherit"`, `"view"`, `"edit"`, `"org_view"`, and `"org_edit"`. `"inherit"` is the default permission applied to files created in a team project, and will inherit the project's permissions. `"org_view"` and `"org_edit"` restrict the link to org users.

        The `document` attribute contains a Node of type `DOCUMENT`.

        The `components` key contains a mapping from node IDs to component metadata. This is to help you determine which components each instance comes from.

        By default, no vector data is returned. To return vector data, pass the geometry=paths parameter to the endpoint.
        Each node can also inherit properties from applicable styles. The styles key contains a mapping from style IDs to style metadata.

        Important: the nodes map may contain values that are `null`. This may be due to the node id not existing within the specified file.

        If no error occurs, `"images"` will be populated with a map from node IDs to URLs of the rendered images, and `"status"` will be omitted. The image assets will expire after 30 days. Images up to 32 megapixels can be exported. Any images that are larger will be scaled down.

        Important: the image map may contain values that are `null`. This indicates that rendering of that specific node has failed. This may be due to the node id not existing, or other reasons such has the node having no renderable components. It is guaranteed that any node that was requested for rendering will be represented in this map whether or not the render succeeded.

        To render multiple images from the same file, use the `ids` query parameter to specify multiple node ids.

            Whether text elements are rendered as outlines (vector paths) or as `<text>` elements in SVGs.

            Rendering text elements as outlines guarantees that the text looks exactly the same in the SVG as it does in the browser/inside Figma.

            Exporting as `<text>` allows text to be selectable inside SVGs and generally makes the SVG easier to read. However, this relies on the browser's rendering engine which can vary between browsers and/or operating systems. As such, visual accuracy is not guaranteed as the result could look different than in Figma.

        There are two methods to query for a user's payment information on a plugin, widget, or Community file. The first method, using plugin payment tokens, is typically used when making queries from a plugin's or widget's code. The second method, providing a user ID and resource ID, is typically used when making queries from anywhere else.

        The `GET /v1/files/:file_key/variables/published` endpoint returns the variables that are published from the given file.

        The response for this endpoint contains some key differences compared to the `GET /v1/files/:file_key/variables/local` endpoint:

        - Each variable and variable collection contains a `subscribed_id`.
        - Modes are omitted for published variable collections

        Published variables have two ids: an id that is assigned in the file where it is created (`id`), and an id that is used by subscribing files (`subscribed_id`). The `id` and `key` are stable over the lifetime of the variable. The `subscribed_id` changes every time the variable is modified and published. The same is true for variable collections.

        The `updatedAt` fields are ISO 8601 timestamps that indicate the last time that a change to a variable was published. For variable collections, this timestamp will change any time a variable in the collection is changed.

        - **variableCollections**: For creating, updating, and deleting variable collections
        - **variableModes**: For creating, updating, and deleting modes within variable collections
          - Each collection can have a maximum of 40 modes
          - Mode names cannot be longer than 40 characters
        - **variables**: For creating, updating, and deleting variables
          - Each collection can have a maximum of 5000 variables
          - Variable names must be unique within a collection and cannot contain certain special characters such as `.{}`
        - **variableModeValues**: For setting a variable value under a specific mode.
          - When setting aliases, a variable cannot be aliased to itself or form an alias cycle

        Temporary ids can be used to reference an object later in the same POST request body. They can be used at create time in the `id` property of variable collections, modes, variables, and in the `initialModeId` property of variable collections. They are scoped to a single request body, and must be unique within the body. The mapping of temporary ids to real ids is returned in the response.

        This endpoint has the following key behaviors:

        - The request body must be 4MB or less.
        - Must include an `action` property for collections, modes, and variables to tell the API whether to create, update, or delete the object.
        - When creating a collection, mode, or variable, you can include a temporary `id` that can be referenced in dependent objects in the same request. For example, you can create a new collection with the id `"my_new_collection"`. You can then set `variableCollectionId` to `"my_new_collection"` in new modes or variables. Temporary ids must be unique in the request body.
        - New collections always come with one mode. You can reference this mode by setting `initialModeId` to a temporary id in the request body. This is useful if you want to set values for variables in the mode in the `variableModeValues` array.
          - The `tempIdToRealId` array returns a mapping of the temporary ids in the request, to the real ids of the newly created objects.
        - When adding new modes or variables, default variable values will be applied, consistent with what happens in the UI.
        - Everything to be created, updated, and deleted in the request body is treated as one atomic operation. If there is any validation failure, you will get a 400 status code response, and no changes will be persisted.
        - You will not be able to update remote variables or variable collections. You can only update variables in the file where they were originally created.

        - Resource points to a `file_key` that cannot be found.
        - The node already has the maximum of 10 dev resources.
        - Another dev resource for the node has the same url.

        A transformation matrix is standard way in computer graphics to represent translation and rotation. These are the top two rows of a 3x3 matrix. The bottom row of the matrix is assumed to be [0, 0, 1]. This is known as an affine transform and is enough to represent translation, rotation, and skew.

        The identity transform is [[1, 0, 0], [0, 1, 0]].

        A translation matrix will typically look like:

        ```
        [[1, 0, tx],
          [0, 1, ty]]
        ```

        and a rotation matrix will typically look like:

        ```
        [[cos(angle), sin(angle), 0],
          [-sin(angle), cos(angle), 0]]
        ```

        Another way to think about this transform is as three vectors:

        - The x axis (t[0][0], t[1][0])
        - The y axis (t[0][1], t[1][1])
        - The translation offset (t[0][2], t[1][2])

        The most common usage of the Transform matrix is the `relativeTransform property`. This particular usage of the matrix has a few additional restrictions. The translation offset can take on any value but we do enforce that the axis vectors are unit vectors (i.e. have length 1). The axes are not required to be at 90° angles to each other.

        Scopes allow a variable to be shown or hidden in the variable picker for various fields. This declutters the Figma UI if you have a large number of variables. Variable scopes are currently supported on `FLOAT`, `STRING`, and `COLOR` variables.

        `ALL_SCOPES` is a special scope that means that the variable will be shown in the variable picker for all variable fields. If `ALL_SCOPES` is set, no additional scopes can be set.

        `ALL_FILLS` is a special scope that means that the variable will be shown in the variable picker for all fill fields. If `ALL_FILLS` is set, no additional fill scopes can be set.

        Valid scopes for `FLOAT` variables:
        - `ALL_SCOPES`
        - `TEXT_CONTENT`
        - `WIDTH_HEIGHT`
